# Design Tokens

Design tokens and style configuration for multiple products as part of a design system.

We use the [Figma Tokens Plugin from Jan Six](https://docs.tokens.studio/) to get the tokens. The Gitlab Repository stores the Design Tokens and in this case is the single source of truth. More information about Gitlab Syncing can be found on <https://docs.tokens.studio/sync/gitlab>.

For the token transformation we are using [Style Dictionary from Amazon](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/). Style Dictionary creates multiple configurations (e.g. CSS-Variables).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Further tasks for linting and testing you can find in the [package.json](package.json).

## Usage

You can get your Design Tokens via the private [@migros/mdx-design-tokens NPM Package](https://repository.migros.net/#browse/browse:MigrosNPMPrivate:%40migros%2Fmdx-design-tokens). The output is separated in brand folders.

### Importing the CSS

Here an example in CSS

```css
@import '@migros/mdx-design-tokens/dist/[BRAND]/light-rem.css';
@import '@migros/mdx-design-tokens/dist/[BRAND]/light-px.css';
```

Here an example in Next.js (inside your Layout.tsx file)

```javascript
import '@migros/mdx-design-tokens/dist/[BRAND]/light-rem.css';
```

### Using the CSS

You are probably already familiar with CSS custom properties being defined in `:root` something like this:

```css
:root {
  --mdx-sys-color-primary-default: rgb(255, 148, 76);
}
```

The css custom properties for the design tokens are however wrapped inside a theme class (e.g. `.themeMLight`). This means you have to explicitly add that class to your html.

```html
<html lang="en" className="themeMLight"></html>
```

Then use one of the tokens and apply it to an element. Here a simple example in Next.js.

```jsx
<html lang="en" className="themeMLight">
  <body>
    <p style={{ color: 'var(--mdx-sys-color-primary-default)' }}>My text is using the MDX primary color</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Replace `.themeMLight` with the class name of your brand.

### Recommendations

The themes for a brand consist of system (sys) and component level tokens. We don't recommend using base level tokens.
